Description
========

The project contains two C++ libraries for symbolic, numeric and graphical
manipulations in non-Euclidean geometry. The first library Cycle implements
basic operations on cycles (quadrics in n-dimensional space) through
SFSCc construction. The second library Figure operates on ensembles
of cycles connected by Moebius-invariant relations, e.g. orthogonality. 

Both libraries are based on the Clifford algebra capacities of the GiNaC
computer algebra system (http://ginac.de ). Besides a C++ library and
there are several Python wrapper of it, which can be used in interactive mode.

The core of Cycle library is done for an arbitrary dimension and
arbitrary signature of the space metric. There are some 2D-specific routines 
including a visualisation to PostScript files through Asymptote
(http://asymptote.sourcefourge.net) software. The source code is
written in literate programming environment NoWeb
(http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/)

Content of the distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The source files for the project are  written using NoWEB.
Here we supply extracted files which can be used without NoWEB installation.
The directories contains the following files:

noweb/        The folder contains *.nw files which are full source of 
                      the progect includig documetation
include/      The folder contains *.h files of the libraries
src/          The folder contains *.ccp files of the libraries and Makefile 
doc/          The folder contains PDF documentation for libraries
examples/     Sample programmes using the libraries.
