		    INSTALLING THE VISUALISATION PROGRAM
			
Before any attempts to build the visualisation software, please ensure that you
have a version of Qt installed that includes the QGLWidget and QSignalMapper
classes (all versions above and including 4.0 have this functionality). A 
version of OpenGL is also required to run the visualisation, as is a C++ 
compiler.

Once the program's files are in a directory, navigate to the "project" folder 
containing the files "main.cpp", "vis.cpp" and "vis.h". Once in this directory,
input the following commands into your console to generate a makefile and 
create an executable:
	$ qmake -project QT+=opengl
	$ qmake
	$ make
	
Once the make has completed, the executable file "project" should appear within 
the directory. To run the visualisation from the console, you will need to 
specify a formatted text file as a command line argument as follows
	./project example.txt 
where "example.txt" is replaced by the name of the file you wish to visualise.

The example file "arrangement.txt" is included in the project directory.

For information on how to use the software see usermanual.pdf.
