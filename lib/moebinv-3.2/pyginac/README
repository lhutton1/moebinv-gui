This folder contains BoostPython wrappers for cycle and figure library. To us it
you will naturally need to install BoostPython (http://www.boost.org/)
ans scons (http://www.scons.org/).

The wrapper is based on pyGiNaC project (http://pyginac.sourceforge.net/),
however files there are outdated and will not work with the current GiNaC.
A user has the following options:

a. either install pre-patched pyGiNaC from pyginac-patched.tar.gz;
b. or download original pyGiNaC distribution  (http://pyginac.sourceforge.net/)
   and patch it from the file pyginac.patch.gz.

After pyGiNaC is unarchived change dir to pyginac folder and run the command

scons

After pyginac will be compiled, unarchive cycle-figure-pyginac.tar.gz to the same
folder and follow instructions from README.libs from this archive.

Files:
pyginac-patched.tar.gz		pre-patched up-to-date pyGiNaC
pyginac.patch.gz		the patch for pyGiNaC as it was originally distributed
cycle-figure-pyginac.tar.gz	wrappers for cycle and figure library (has its own README)
epal-v1-examples.tar.gz		pyGiNaC programmes distributed with "Geometry of Moebius transformations" book's DVD
