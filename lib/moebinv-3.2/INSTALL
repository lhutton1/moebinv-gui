I do not provide an installation script or instructions, here is just
an indication.

Change the directory to ./src/ and type "make", this shall produce two
library files for you.

Then change directory to ../examples and again type "make", this shall
compile hello-cycle simple programme. Try if it would work for you.

To use 3D visualiser follow instructions in file
cycle3D-visualiser/INSTALL

If you want to have Pyhon wrapper for the library, read
pycycle/INSTALL

I hope you will figure out the rest.
